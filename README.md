# 531 Training App (V2)

This is a workout app that primarily follows the 5/3/1 training program, but users can add their own programs. It uses my previous app as a backbone but uses a culinination of all the things I learned over the past year: improved software engineering structure, implemented a document style database with Firebase, used Git branches, and improved development cycle (basically more planning and lots of feedback)
