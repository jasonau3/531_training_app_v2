# 531 Training App (V2)

This 531 Training App uses my previous app as a backbone but upgrades many things. A culinination of all the things I learned over the past year: improved software engineering structure, implemented a document style database with Firebase, used Git branches, and improved development cycle (basically more planning and lots of feedback)
